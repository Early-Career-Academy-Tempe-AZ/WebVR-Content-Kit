<h1>WebVR Content Kit</h1>
<h2>Virtual Reality for the Web</h2>

<p>Welcome to the <strong>WebVR Content Kit</strong> where you can find all the resources you will ever need about the WebVR. You can use it to learn the topic yourself or teach it to others either by giving a conference talk or running a hands-on workshop.</p>

<h2>Content Kit materials</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://end3r.github.io/WebVR-Content-Kit/setup/">Instructions on how to setup the VR hardware</a></li>
	<li>Slide deck for the conference talk</li>
	<li>Working demo to showcase the API</li>
	<li>Resources list with all the interesting links</li>
</ul>

<p>This Content Kit can be used as a base for the conference talk material, workshop, online training or whatever else comes to your mind. You can use the slides containing the commented, explained snippets of code to present the topic to the audience, or you can run a live-coding session showing people how to build a demo that supports use of VR headset from scratch. You can also add your own content or trim the existing one if you have limited time for the talk.</p>

<h2>Technical difficulties</h2>

<p>You may encounter some technical difficulties during your time with the VR headset. If the API is not working properly you will need to reconnect it, restart the browser or in some cases even the computer.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<p>Remember that the audience may have some questions about the topic. Be sure to feel comfortable with what you're presenting. Don't worry if you don't know the answer to a question - you can always tell them you'll check it and answer later, or you can point them to any of the external resources so they can check it themselves.</p>
